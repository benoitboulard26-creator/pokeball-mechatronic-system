# 3D Printed Parts – Technical Notes

## Design & CAD
All parts were designed using: CATIA V5.
The models were created with proper constraints, verified assemblies, and clean geometries.

## Tolerances & Testing
- The parts have been **tested and adjusted with tolerances** suitable for FDM 3D printing.
- They were specifically validated for printing on an **:Ender 3 V3 SE**.
- Fit and assembly were checked after printing.

## Printing Disclaimer
Depending on:
- your printer calibration  
- filament type  
- layer height and extrusion settings  

**minor sanding may be required** to achieve a perfect fit.  
This is normal and expected, as tolerances can vary slightly from one printer to another.

## Recommendations
- Ensure your printer is well-calibrated (steps/mm, flow rate).
- Use standard PLA or PETG profiles as a baseline.
- Light post-processing (sanding) is recommended if parts feel tight.
